Answer as many of these as you like and post them in a gist to share your responses with us to review … this really saves everyone a LOT of time:

What are examples of the types of projects you have deployed to Azure? I have worked on projects requiring a virtual machine to be set up in Azure and deploying .NET Framework and .NET Core (to support Unix as well) that served SPAs for Third Party Liability health claims (including being HIPAA compliant on both the code and server set up), serving WebAPIs for license and versioning in production applications, and data analysis and reporting tools.

How do you classify your senior-ness as a developer? What are your development strengths? I consider myself to be a very experienced developer, or as I guess it is said in the industry quite often, a senior software engineer. I am fairly language and platform agnostic, and I am extremely quick to learn an unfamiliar technology. I am flexible to technologies to be used, where I will give my recommendations for perfect/good/acceptable scenarios but I am more than happy to be told what I need to use.

What are your top 1-2 favorite editor(s)? VSCode and Visual Studio for IDEs and Notepad++ and Sublime Text for text editors.

Have you ever done a pull request? Yes!

Have you ever had a chance to use TDD? Have you found it to be helpful? If so, when does it work best for you? I have used test driven development, and I have found it to be both helpful and not-so-helpful. In smaller applications or low complexity applications I find it to be very helpful in focusing my development, almost like writing an outline for a story first. In complex or large applications I find it to be helpful in the sense that breaking up functionality into small segments and approaching it with TDD makes it each piece resilient and covered completely but it can slow down the initial development time and cause confusion as scenarios are run into that initial TDD did not cover.

Have you been given the opportunity to use tools like ReSharper? What did you like about it? I have used ReSharper in previous employers and I really enjoyed how it made it much easier to do whole solution refactorings.

Do you prefer working directly with the business people? Or do you find it's best to have a go-between run interference? I do not have a preference as I believe each developer should be able to manage their own projects if a PM is not a part of the team organization and I've found that it generally makes projects much more easily understood by all parties if developers are in contact with the business directly.

Have you ever used web.config transformations? If not, do you know what they are good for? I have used web.config transforms but I do know of them and how they can help set defaults for missing environment variables or for setting up values for environment variables based on if the application is being run in debug/production/staging.

Can you tell me anything about 'slots' in terms of Azure? If not, based on what you just googled, how would you use them in your next Azure project? I had not been familiar with Azure slots, but after googling it and reading some MS documentation it seems like it would be fairly useful as its own form web.config transforms in a continuous development type thing.

Have you worked with any of the cloud providers (Heroku, AWS, Azure, Google)? Azure and AWS.

Can you explain what DevOps and/or continuous integration is, and some of the benefits? DevOps, I believe, replaced Team Foundation Server and it combines source repository and deployment chains in a flexible way that allows some mixing and matching (such as developing in VS, committing to Git, and deploying to AWS, all through Azure and being able to monitor statistics from end to end).

Are you technology agnostic? Or are you pretty strict when it comes to things like Mac vs Windows, or AWS vs Azure? Fairly agnostic. I am more comfortable in Windows and Unix, but have no problems working on a Mac. I couldn't care less about if I'm using AWS or Azure. I enjoy learning new languages and find that each language typically has its own positives and negatives for any given task at hand.

What are some of your more advanced SQL querying abilities (i.e., like what keywords or commands, etc)? I'm very proficient in generating cubes of data with subqueries and left/right joins, using the My_Schema.Tables for getting dynamic table names and columns, data constraints and ordering, grouping, MATH functions, and numerous other SQL things.

Do you happen to know what TypeScript is and why it’s gotten popular? How does it differ from JS? I have used TypeScript! It is strongly typed that compiles to plain javascript and it scales super nicely!!

How comfortable are you in working a project that involves touching some CSS and HTML? Extremely comfortable.

Can you explain the diff b/t relational databases and NoSQL? What are some NoSQL platforms that you have familiarity with? NoSQL doesn't have relationships (necessarily) with tables, such as MongoDBs json-like documents and pages whereas relational dbs such as MSSQL or PL/SQL (for Oracle) have tables that have a relationship between tables such as an ID that links the tables.

Can you explain GPG, SSL or public/private key encryption? Not in anything more than broad terms. Essentially, there is a key or cipher that allows the client/server to encrypt/decrypt data so that in the event the data is hijacked it is supposedly unreadable by the hijacker.

Do you know anything about "secure coding" practices? I know a little...such as using OWASP or OAuth tokens.

Can _you_ authenticate to GitHub using SSH? Sure, I would have to generate a key and add it to my account (I actually do have a PAT set up for this Listify project I made for this submission)

Can you explain what REST sorta kinda means? REST is basically an architectural style for distributed systems, like the Internet! Clients and servers are separated, each client request has to carry all the required data for the server which means the server doesn't know anything about the state of the client or its request until that request comes in, and it is much easier and simplistic to keep server and client funcionality separated and code minimised.

How enthusiastic would you be if we asked to pay you to take some training courses on Udemy? Can I take some now?!?!?!

How many of these platforms / languages / frameworks do you have experience with? Node ,Typescript, Angular, React, SQL, Excel, Python, Linux, Mac, Windows, Jasmine, Docker, .NET, C#, NUnit, Go, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, bash, shell, scripts, PowerShell, MongoDB, Azure, and AWS.
